<h3>Description</h3>
<p>Fresh peaches wrapped in crescent roll dough, drizzled with a caramel-like sauce, and baked until the fruit is tender. They are soft and gooey on the bottom, but crisp on top, and the taste is very similar to peach cobbler. So easy to make, but taste like you labored all day over them.</p>

<h2>Ingredients</h2>
<ul>
    <li>
       2 large fresh peaches, halved and pitted 
    </li>

    <li>
        1 teaspoon ground cinnamon
    </li>

        1 (12 fluid ounce) can or bottle citrus soda (such as Mountain Dew)
    </li>
</ul>
